# disgusting-treap

### Implementation of implicit cartesian tree (treap) that can handle queries:

1. query sum on segment $[l, r]$
2. insert element $x$ on position $pos$
3. erase $pos$-th element
4. assign $x$ on segment $[l, r]$
5. add $x$ on segment $[l, r]$
6. next_permutation on segment $[l, r]$
7. prev_permutation on segment $[l, r]$

Each query is executed in $O(\log n)$ time.
